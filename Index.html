  <h3>Education</h3>
  Starting from the beginning:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>City Montessori School</strong>: Did my first 9 year of education from here,<em> Montessori-Class 6th </em> </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As far as I remmember, during these year I was always in a quest of scoring some extra marks and wanted to be among the top scorers in my class.
      </li>
      <li>I was a typical hardworking studious person with an excellent handwriting, people tend praise me for this quite often. </li>
      <li>Next I remmember is that I was extremly introvert Af.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <strong> Bal Vidya Mandir</strong>: Carried my further studies till Intermediate from 7 i.e, <em>6 year</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Haha I remmember my first year in BVM, you won't beileve I didn't spoke in school for that whole year, to be specific I was in 7th grade.</li>
        <li>Then kicks in the 8th grade, I started opening to classmate, it's was a very new and fun experince from a perspective of person who raerly opened up easliy
          in a social setting.</li>
        <li>Speaking about 9th & 10th, the fun we used to have can't be explained through a bunch of words! All I would would say is during these two year I
          explored my personality that wasn't earlier facilitated to show the way it did during those two years!</li>
        <li>
          11th & 12th...Ahh! A lot was going on but what I wish to mention is the fact that "I took Hummaniies for the sake of Fashion Designing, I was obssesed."
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Collage</strong>? Will Update soon, something mischivious going on in my head XD</li>
